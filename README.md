# personalWebSite

This project is the very first website I created for myself as I was teaching myself web development skills (JS, HTML, CSS)

In the future I would like to add:
  more visual elements (pictures, animations, etc.)
  build more games to broaden my JavaScript and game dev knowledge
  multiple layers to the web page in order to create a more dynamic site
